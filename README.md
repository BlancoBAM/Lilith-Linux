## 🎮 Deepin Source Code Integration

### What Makes This Revolutionary

**Traditional Approach:**
- Configuration file modifications
- Package-level changes
- Surface-level branding
- Limited customization

**Lilith Approach:**
- **Source code modifications** in actual Deepin components
- **Binary-level rebranding** of desktop environment
- **Custom GTK/Qt themes** compiled directly into components
- **Deep system integration** at the lowest level

### What Gets Customized at Source Level

```bash
# Deepin Desktop Environment Components:
✅ dde-daemon         - Core system daemon
✅ dde-session-ui     - Session manager
✅ dde-control-center - Settings panel
✅ dde-file-manager   - File browser
✅ dde-dock          - Taskbar component
✅ dde-launcher      - Application launcher

# System Rebranding:
✅ All "Deepin" → "Lilith" replacements
✅ Chinese language dependency removal
✅ Custom themes baked into binaries
✅ Desktop environment rebranding
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Source integration fails:**
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /opt

# Clean and retry
sudo rm -rf /opt/lilith-sources
lilith-source-integration.sh
```

**AI model download fails:**
```bash
# Check network connectivity
ping huggingface.co

# Manual download if needed
cd /opt/lilith-ai/models
wget [model-url] -O main-model.gguf
```

### Performance Issues

**AI responses slow:**
- Reduce model size (7B → 3B)
- Use more aggressive quantization (Q4_K_M → Q2_K)
- Decrease context length (2048 → 1024)
- Check CPU thermal limits

**High memory usage:**
```bash
# Monitor AI memory usage
lilith-admin memory-profile

# Adjust quantization
lilith-admin set-quantization Q3_K_L
```

### Integration Problems

**Desktop hotkey not working:**
```bash
# Check if service is running
systemctl status lilith-ai

# Verify hotkey registration
lilith-admin list-shortcuts
```
